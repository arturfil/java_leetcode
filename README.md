    In this repo I'm going to be puting all the problems in review from leetcode, in java.
    <br />
    I created a exec.sh file in order to rm old .class files, recompile and run the Main.class file.
    <br/>
    To follow along, if you fork this repo, you have to give permission to your exec.sh file to execute it.<br/> Use the command:  
    
</p>

```
chmod 755 exec.sh
```

<p>
    I will also put a <strong>TESTING</strong> and <strong>EXPLANATION</strong> title
    in each file. <br/>
    Grab the code under testing and put it in the main class.
    <br/>
    That way you can see how to test the problem and the reasoning behind it. <br/>
    👨🏼‍💻&nbsp Ok that's all. 🖖🏼
