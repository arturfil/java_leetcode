# Java LeetCode
<p>
    In this repo I'm going to be puting all the problems for leetcode in java.
    <br />
    I created a exce.sh file in order to rm old Main.class file, recompile and run the Main.class file
    <br/>
    To follow along if you fork this repo, you have to give persission to your .sh file to execute with: 
    
</p>
```
chmod 755 exec.sh
```
<p>
    I will also put a <strong>TESTING</strong> and <strong>EXPLANATION</strong> title
    in each file. <br/>
    That way you can see how to test the problem and the resoning behind it. <br/>
